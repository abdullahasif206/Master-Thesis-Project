# Data Evaluation of 3-axis Acceleromter and 3-axis Gyroscope on vehicle door | Scenerio Classification using Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction
This repository contains a project focused on classifying scenarios using data from a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope mounted on a vehicle door. A hybrid CNN-LSTM model is implemented to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in the sensor data for accurate scenario classification.
